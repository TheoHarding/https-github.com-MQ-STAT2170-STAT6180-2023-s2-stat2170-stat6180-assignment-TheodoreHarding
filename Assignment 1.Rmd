# Load the traffic data
```{r}
traffic <- read.csv("traffic.csv")
```

## Part A
Calculate correlation matrix and create a scatterplot matrix
```{r}
cor(traffic)
pairs(traffic)

```

## Part B
Fit a linear regression model


```{r}
fit <- lm(spi ~ ., data = traffic)
summary(fit)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
